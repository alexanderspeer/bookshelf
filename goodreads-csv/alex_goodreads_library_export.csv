What I could understand was intuitive.<br/>Here I go: I would like to discuss one of the implications of Kant’s universal maxim (acting as if your action would establish a precedent for future human action), the act of assisting another in need, or some notion akin to altruism. Since Kant died 5 years before Darwin, It can be intuited that the former would have no prescience of the evolutionary principle that the fittest organism passes on their genes. Moreover, since it is generally taken that self-interested individuals fare better in Darwin's little battle royale, it is puzzling to imagine how an individual possessing altruistic tendencies would be afforded the chance to pass on their genes. Over time, researchers have produced a few theories concerning the reproduction of altruistic behaviors in the gene pool. Reciprocal altruism, rooted in humans' social capacity, sees individuals engaging in mutually beneficial behaviors with the expectation of assistance in return. Group selection suggests that altruistic tendencies within a group contribute to collective success, favoring cooperative traits through competition with other groups. Cooperative groups gain a competitive advantage, exemplified by mutual support, enhancing overall survival prospects. Kant’s beliefs, which align most closely with reciprocal altruism, suggest an individual be motivated to assist another human based primarily on the principle that we would want someone to do the same for us. Both theories posit ostensibly selfless action in the hopes of future return, or, in as Darwin would put it, a better chance at survival. I just thought it was interesting how someone before Darwin's time seems to have arrived at the same monumental conclusion with just the thoughts in their head, some paper, and have done so without ever leaving his modest town. <br/> ",,,1,0

Walk through it again. Oh wait, ""state of nature"" Alexander wants to say something. Go ahead buddy: I believe Rousseau's social theory grapples with inherent contradictions within the concept of the natural man, particularly in the avoidance of murder. During the reading, the question arises as to whether a natural man can genuinely exist simply for himself, primarily when basic needs like food, a mate, and sleep become contested. Rousseau contends that the natural man engages in violence only for self-preservation, yet this assertion appears contradictory, as it implies a threat from others. I think it is pretty similar to the scenario where the first person planting signs around their property initiates a widespread practice, sort of like how the act of killing for self-preservation would seem to necessitate an initial act of aggression from others. <br/>",,,1,0
