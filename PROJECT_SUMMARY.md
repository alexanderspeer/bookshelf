Title: Personal Library Management System

Summary: A digital library platform that transforms how I track, organize, and visualize my reading journey. Built as a full-stack application combining modern web technologies with algorithmic ranking systems, the project represents a deep dive into both frontend visualization techniques and backend data architecture.

Description: The Personal Library Management System is an interactive web application that lets users build, customize, and share their personal libraries through an immersive bookshelf visualization experience. Users can add books by searching the Open Library API, import entire collections from Goodreads CSV exports, and organize their reading across three dynamic shelves: Want to Read, Currently Reading, and Read. When finishing a book, an interactive ranking wizard guides users through a series of pairwise comparisons—presenting head-to-head matchups with similar books—to determine precise placement within a ranked list. The wizard uses binary search algorithms to minimize comparisons while ensuring books are positioned correctly within their star-rating groups, so a 5-star book never ranks below a 4-star book.

The centerpiece of the application is a real-time bookshelf renderer that generates photorealistic visualizations of users' collections. Users can customize every aspect of their shelf through an extensive theme manager: choose from preset color palettes like "Vintage Library," "Ocean Breeze," or "Sunset Warmth," or create custom themes by selecting shelf background colors, border colors, and book color schemes from 30+ preset swatches or custom hex pickers. The system offers 20+ font options for book spines—from classic serifs like Garamond to playful scripts like Brush Script—with live previews showing how titles will appear. Users can apply bulk color schemes (Pastel Dreams, Vibrant & Bold, Ocean Blues, Earth Tones, Purple Haze, Forest Greens, Monochrome) or individually color books, save unlimited custom themes, and switch between them instantly.

The bookshelf visualization engine automatically generates spine images for books without covers, extracting dominant colors from cover art when available, calculating book dimensions from physical measurements, and rendering titles rotated 270 degrees with dynamically sized fonts that fit perfectly within spine boundaries. Users can click on any book in the rendered shelf to view details, edit metadata, add personal notes, or link it to other books through "thought continuations"—creating a directed graph that maps how one book's themes intellectually continue into another, allowing users to visualize their reading pathways and discover connections between works.

Reading goals can be set for yearly, monthly, or weekly periods, with real-time progress tracking that calculates the exact pace needed (books per day, week, or month) to meet targets. The system tracks completion dates, displays progress bars with percentage completion, and allows users to view all books that contributed to a goal. Books can be organized with custom tags featuring color coding, merged for consolidation, and filtered by tag, shelf, author, or search query. The ranking system supports both algorithmic placement through the wizard and manual drag-and-drop reordering, with derived ratings calculated on a 0-10 scale based on position within the ranked list.

Public user profiles enable sharing bookshelves via username-based URLs (e.g., /u/username), allowing friends to browse collections, view reading statistics, and see goal progress. The interface features a retro RPG-inspired aesthetic using the RPGUI framework, with pixel-art cursors, golden borders, and potion-themed star ratings. Users can download their rendered bookshelves as images, view interactive hover states that highlight books on mouseover, and experience progressive rendering with configurable cascade delays that animate books appearing on the shelf one by one.

The architecture supports seamless deployment from local SQLite development to Heroku PostgreSQL production through an intelligent database abstraction layer that automatically converts queries between database systems. The backend implements session-based authentication, RESTful API endpoints for all operations, and caching strategies for performance. The frontend uses React with TypeScript for type safety, Canvas API for high-performance rendering, and react-beautiful-dnd for smooth drag-and-drop interactions.
